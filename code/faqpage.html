We'll update the content of this page every now and then. If there's something you'd like to have added here.<br />
<h2>General</h2><br />
<ul>
<b><li>What is Hostel administration system?</li></b><br />
NAC (Network Administration Control) was introduced in NITK as one of the requirements of the IT act (2008) and it is now mandatoryto log on to NITK Authentication server before accessing internet anywhere on campus.<br /><br />
<b><li>Can anybody use the campus internet?</li></b><br />
No, only staff and students with a valid NAC ID can access internet.<br /><br />
<b><li>Is there a doctor on campus?</li></b><br />
Yes, we have a doctor who resides on campus. Contact details are given on the contacts page.<br /><br />
<b><li>Is there a counsellor at NITK?</li></b><br />
Yes, a counsellor is available at the Health Care Centre. Contact HCC if further details are required.<br /><br />
<b><li>I have been given a health insurance card. How and under what conditions is the card valid?</li></b><br />
The insurance is valid only if you get 'admitted' to a hospital. Even then, you have to pay for the bills initially and then when you're well again, go to your HCC and ask �for the re-imbursement form. Fill it up, get it signed by your block warden and submit it. You can find the list of hospitals where your card is valid on the website of the insurer.<br /><br />
<b><li>How do I use the Sports Equipment of the college and what are the timings?</li></b><br />
Sports equipment that are the property of NITK can be borrowed from the Sports Complex after handing over your ID card to the person in-charge. You can retrieve your ID card once you have returned the borrowed equipment. Timings are mentioned under the 'Facilities' section.<br /><br />
<b><li>I need to apply for a passport. Should I give my home address or college address?</li></b><br />
The passport website says that you should give your current address. If you are a hosteler, the residential certificate (Proof of residence) may be obtained from the Hostel Office. An application form has to be filled there and your certificate will be made available in a day or two after verification. You will not be charged for this form.<br /><br />
<b><li>Where can I get a document that proves I am a student at NITK (Bona fide Certificate)?</li></b><br />
The application for a Bona fide Certificate has to filled in at the Exam Section (First Floor, Main building). The document will be ready within 24 hours after verification.<br /><br />
<b>My parents/relatives/friends intend to visit me at NITK, how do I get accommodation for them at one of the Guest Houses?</b><br />
You need to go to the office of the Dean (Faculty Welfare) (First Floor, in the Directorate, the AC corridor) and ask the secretary for a form for accommodation in the Guest house. You need to fill it and get it signed by your HOD. Then you need to submit the form to the same secretary again. Still this doesn't guarantee you a room. Once you have done this, after a day or two, you need to check at the Guest House Incharge (The owner of the Reddy shop) whether rooms are available during those dates or not.�Unless there is some big event going on in the institute (Inci, Engi), getting rooms should not be a problem.<br /><br />
<b><li>What do I do in case I lose my ID Card?</li></b><br />
Go the cash section. Pay the fine. Collect the receipt. Go to the Dean (Students' Welfare) Office and submit the receipt. You can collect a duplicate ID Card from there.<br /><br />
</ul>
<h2>Hostel</h2><br />
<ul>
<b><li>My room's power just went off. What do I do?</li></b><br />
If the problem is for all the hostel blocks: Wait for a couple of hours at least. Chances are, the power lines are damaged and it wouldn't be within the control of college authorities to get it back on.<br />
If the problem is for your block alone and other blocks have power: Wait for half an hour and then notify your Hostel Representatives who will notify either the Student Council President or the Resident Engineer.<br />
If the problem is restricted to your room/wing alone: Notify the above mentioned people immediately.<br />
In case of power outage after 11pm, it will be nearly impossible to rectify the problem until the next morning.<br /><br />
<b><li>Am I allowed to use high power consuming devices in my room?</li></b><br />
The rules clearly ask you to register and pay an extra amount in order to use power consuming devices.<br />
It is to be noted that there have been cases in the Mega Hostels of the entire wing's fuse getting blown off due to excess power consumption, like hooking up too many computers in the same plug/room, using too many soldering irons, drill machines, electric kettles or induction stoves. Caution is advised before using them.<br /><br />
<b><li>How do I change my mess?</li></b><br />
Write a letter addressed to the Chief Warden stating why you need a change of mess and to which mess you want to be transferred to. Submit this letter to the Hostel Superintendent. You will also be required to surrender your previous mess card. Your application will be considered only if there is a vacancy in the other mess. Otherwise you may have to find someone from the other mess who is willing to take your place in your old mess and the two students must submit a combined application.<br /><br />
<b><li>What do I do if one my wingmates/hostel mates keeps disturbing me by playing loud music etc. and refuses to stop this kind of behaviour even after warning him?</li></b><br/>
Ask the concerned people to tone it down a bit. If you don't want to confront them directly, ask your floor's Hostel rep (information available under Students' Council -->Hostel Reps on this site) to warn them. If there is still no improvement in the situation, as a last resort you may inform your warden about the problem.<br /><br />
